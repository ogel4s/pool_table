# pool_table
A simple code to simulate the impact of a ball on a billiard table without friction.
The process of evolution is that we place one or more balls in a point and specify the initial direction of movement for each one, and the program continues until the entire page is scrolled.

**Of course, it may not be scrollable with a full-screen ball**

In this program, we display directions with 1 and -1 â†“
  1. Move to the right (+x) : 1
  2. Move to the left (-x) : -1
  3. Move to the up (-y) : -1
  4. Move to the down (+y) : 1
